# The Tryrb Gem

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/tryrb.png)][gem]
[gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/tryrb

#### Try ruby in a fascinating way

Open a temp file to edit using your favorite editor by one command.

## Installation

```
$ gem install tryrb
```

## Why creating this?

Maybe you try some some ruby scripts like this often:

```
$ cd ~/tmp
$ vim foooooooo.rb
$ ruby foooooooo.rb
```

You have to change working directory, figure out a name(and make sure it doesn't exist), finally try to find the file to run.It's bothering!ðŸ˜¡

But this gem provide an easy way to do this.ðŸ’›

## Usage

##### The simplest and fastest way:

```
$ tryrb c(reate)
# Editing ruby code
$ tryrb e(xec)
```
A file named, for exmaple, `201401010909.rb` will be created and executed.

More options:

### Create a temp file

##### Specify a name

```
$ tryrb create foo
```

A file named, for exmaple, `201401010909_foo.rb` will be created.

### Execute a ruby script

##### Last one file in your temp dir

```
$ tryrb exec
```

##### Last one file containing `foo`

```
$ tryrb exec foo
```

##### Last nth file

```
$ tryrb exec -l n
```

##### Last nth file containing name `foo`

```
$ tryrb exec -l n foo
```

### Config

You can configure your editor and temp directory via a file in `~/.tryrbrc`, it looks like this:

```yaml
tmp_dir: ~/tmp/tryrb
editor: vim
```

So that the file your create will be created using vim in `~/tmp/tryrb` directory.

### Alias

`c` is alias of `create`, and `e` is alias of `exec`.

### Get help

```
$ tryrb help command
```

The command is `create`, `c`, `exec` or `e` for the moment.
